            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Deſign of this Addreſs is neither to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim your <hi>Merits,</hi> nor to beg your <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,</hi> (the, too, common Theme of Epiſtles) but to give you a naked Account of the Origin of this Birth; which was a Queſtion propounded to me by one of you, under the Roof of the other, Whether I knew of any one that had contracted the Hiſtory of the Bible into a narrow compaſs? I anſwer'd in the Negative. But the Queſtion made ſome impreſſion upon me, and gave me the firſt hint of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which thereupon I applied my ſelf unto, and purſued till I brought it to this iſſue which you ſee. This occaſion, in conjunction with my great Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Family</hi> of one of you, will more than juſtifie this preſent Dedication.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that if this Task had been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by ſome Hands, it would have been dreſs'd up after a more genteel and faſhionable manner, and appeared in a far more gay and ſplendid Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page: But for my part, I am not wont to trade in Silks, Sattins, and ſuch coſtly, Court-like Attire: I leave them to ſuch as frequent King's Palaces. A plain Country Garb agrees better with my Mind and Purſe: Such therefore I have provided for it, and beſtow'd upon it.</p>
            <p>For the Work it ſelf, the <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> hereof is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, both as an <hi>Abridgment,</hi> and as <hi>ſuch an Abridgment.</hi> As an <hi>Abridgment,</hi> it's helpful, not only to the <hi>Memory,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Judgment</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:60894:3"/> 
               <hi>Underſtanding:</hi> for, by laying paſſages cloſer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and bringing 'em into a narrower Compaſs, one may take the fuller proſpect of 'em, and more eaſily apprehend the Frame of the whole.</p>
            <p>Then as its an <hi>Abridgment of the Holy Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſo its uſeful in many reſpects. For, in general, <hi>All theſe things were written for our learning,</hi> (Rom. <hi>15.4—) and admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10.11.</hi> To teach us, <hi>particularly,</hi> in reference to Kingdoms and Nations, that Piety is the beſt Policy: That <hi>Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation, but ſin is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to</hi> (and the ruin of) <hi>any People,</hi> Prov. <hi>14.34.</hi> and, That <hi>the Lord is with us while we keep cloſe to him;— but if we forſake him he'll forſake us, 2</hi> Chron. <hi>15.2.</hi> And then, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to particular perſons, they ſerve to teach us how to govern our ſelves in all caſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and in all capacities and relations. The Examples of <hi>Judgments</hi> on Tranſgreſſors are <hi>Warnings</hi> to us to avoid the like ſins for which they ſmarted, <hi>1 Cor. 10.6-11.</hi> The Examples of <hi>Bleſſings</hi> on the Obedient, are <hi>Encouragements</hi> to us to practiſe the like Duties, and Exerciſe the ſame Graces for which they were rewarded, <hi>Rom. 4.23, 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If what is here done may be of any uſe to you, (Gentlemen) or to any others, to promote your Acquaintance with, and delight in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and diſpoſe you to a greater diligence in the ſtudy thereof, I ſhall rejoyce in this fruit of my Labours; and likewiſe in this opportunity of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſlender Teſtemony to the world, that I am,</p>

            <head>The Introduction.</head>
            <p>THO' God was what he is, and in the perfect fruition of his own Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from all Eternity, before his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Hand had drawn the Creatures out of their Nothing; yet his Nature required Homages, his Majeſty Servitudes, his Glory Admirations, his Goodneſs Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, and his Beauty Hearts and Affections. It was needful, tho he were Independant of all Beings, Immenſe in his Extent, Eternal in his Duration, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in all his Perfections, that he ſhould cauſe himſelf to be ſeen and felt by Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations out of Himſelf. It was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (methinks) that God ſhould contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate himſelf in the mirror of his Eſſence,
<pb facs="tcp:60894:4"/> and that, without iſſuing out of Himſelf, he ſhould beget his <hi>Word</hi> in the Splendors which flow from his Clarity: It was not enough to love Himſelf, and in loving Himſelf to produce without change, loſs or alteration, the Sacred Spirit and Fire of his Love: All theſe immanent and infinite Productions could not exhauſt the Treaſures of ſo fruitful a Nature; for in giving it ſelf it ſuffers no detriment, ſince amidſt theſe Sallies and Emanations the Father and the Son in ſuch ſort communicate their Natures and Perfections, the Father to the Son, and both to the Holy-Ghoſt, that all Three by a common power can act <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> or exteriourly; and they needed to employ but one ſingle Word to create, not only a World, but even Worlds without end.</p>
            <p>I repreſent unto my ſelf that Nature ſigh'd even without Tongue or Voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had a Being: Methinks I hear her Silence, and that ſhe ſaith to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Creation,</p>
            <p>Speak then, O ſpeak: (Great God) Stretch forth thy Arm, and caſt thy Looks out of thy Self: Iſſue forth of the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb facs="tcp:60894:4"/> Darkneſs, which forms thee a Day without Night, and a Night more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendant than the Day. Give ſome little paſſage to thoſe Ejaculations and Flames, which from all Eternity are encloſed within thy Boſom, and which frame therein a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Light and Love. Thou needſt but open thy mouth, and immediately all Creatures will be obedient to thy Commands: The leaſt of thy Irradiations will ſcatter the ſhadows, and open that Abyſs in which they are buried. It is true, that nothing ought to diſturb the peace and repoſe of thy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude: It is true, Thou haſt and poſſeſſeſt in thy Self all that can ever be; but Thou canſt bring it to light, and art able without noiſe and diſorder to break that eternal Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which hitherto has made Thee heard but of thy Self. In fine, Thou art a God of Love, and this Love would be captive, if it had not Sallies and Ejaculations. It was not ſatisfyed to remain in thee by Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and as it were in the ſource of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Goodneſs; but having made its folds within it ſelf by numberleſs revolutions, it muſt deſcend upon external objects, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that effect and property which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:60894:5"/> to Love, <hi>viz.</hi> That amorous Extaſie, that prodigious Effuſion, that pompous and magnificent ſhew, which to ſpeak properly, Is the Torch of Love; or rather, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of its Triumph.</p>
            <p>Well then, Creatures, come forth of the Maſs in which you lie confuſed; Heaven, Earth, Sea, Stars, Trees, Fiſhes, Furnaces of Fire and Flames, vaſt Extents of Air, Clouds, Abyſſes, Precipices, liſten to the Voice and Command of God, of the Word, and of their Love. O God! O Power! O Love! What Word? What Speech? and what Voice?</p>
            <p>In fine, this glorious and happy moment, which ſaw the Birth of Times and Seaſons, being arrived, the Eternal God ſeeing no Object out of Himſelf which could deſerve his Love; and beſides this, Love being incited by a holy deſire of communicating it ſelf, that Nothing, which has but the bare Name given it, became immediately a fruitful Abyſs of Eſſences, and Nature was engendred out of it by the ſole power of the Divinity. <hi>Talon's Holy Hiſtory, cap. 1.</hi>
